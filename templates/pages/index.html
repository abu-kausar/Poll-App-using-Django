        Polls marked with an asterisk are partisan polls.
        Partisanship is determined by who sponsors the poll, rather than who conducts it.
        Polls are considered partisan if theyâ€™re conducted on behalf of a candidate, party, campaign committee, or PAC, super PAC, 501(c)(4), 501(c)(5) or 501(c)(6) organization that conducts a large majority of its political activity on behalf of one political party.
